# Koober Tech Interview

## Guidelines

- [duplicate](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/) this repository (do **not** fork it)
- solve the levels in ascending order
- commit often to show the evolution of the code


## What we expect

- clean code (ES6, Typescript, Flow allowed)
- tests (Show your best skills : TDD, unit, integration and more)
- use any tool if they can be installed through NPM
- comments when you need to clarify a design decision or assumptions about the spec
- a simple way to run the code and the tests (write doc if necessary)

## Acknowledgements

This test is shamelessly inspired by the Auchan:Direct interview, which was inspired by the Drivy interview :-) .
