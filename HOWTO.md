# Tech Interview

## Intention

This test simulates a scenario where the *Tech team* needs to create a new service in production.
Each level corresponds to a new iteration with new requirements emitted by a *Product Team* as they are learning new constraints of the business.

This test aims to evaluate the following candidate skills :

### Technical level

- the technical level in Typescript language
- the technical level in a NodeJS ecosystem (npm, yarn, etc.)

### Team player skills

- the ability to use tools or patterns in order to improve productivity, robust code
- the ability to write code that will be read and modified by other people

### Workflow

- the way of reasoning (i.e. the way of obtaining the result is very important, rather than just the result)
- the way of organizing work on a feature

## Expected work

- code should be clean (Latest ECMA syntax, safe Typescript, layer separation)
- tests should be present (Show your best skills : TDD, unit, integration and more)
- synchronous IO should not be used (ex: use fs.readdir not fs.readdirSync)
- it must run in a MacOS and Linux environment, assume that only npm and node LTS are already installed
- documentation files should be added
- comments in code could be added when you need to clarify a design decision or assumptions about the spec


## Guidelines

- [duplicate](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/) this repository (do **not** fork it)
- solve the levels in ascending order
- commit often and atomically to show the evolution of the code step by step

When finished, provide a link to your repository

## Acknowledgements

This test is shamelessly inspired by the Auchan:Direct interview, which was inspired by the Drivy interview :-) .
